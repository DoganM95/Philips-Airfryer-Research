    <string name="privacy_policy_text_android">"NutriU Privacy Notice
This Privacy Notice was last updated on July 1st, 2021.

The Philips NutriU app (“App”) provides you with personalized nutrition services, creates a community to share cooking related content and allows you to follow other community members with similar interests around the world. The App may also provide you with offers on our products and/or third party offers (“Services”). The App uses personal data collected or processed through the App, including personal data processed by any Philips kitchen appliance that you decide to pair with the App (for example, a Philips blender) (“Device”).

The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to help you understand our privacy practices when you use our Services, including what information and personal data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it, as well as your individual rights. This Privacy Notice applies to personal data collected or processed by the App, which is controlled by or under control of Philips Domestic Appliances (China) Investment Co., Ltd. or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries (”Philips”, “our”, “we” or “us”). 

Please also read our Terms of Use, which describe the terms under which you use our Services.

What Personal Data are collected and for which Purposes
We receive or collect personal data, as described in detail below, when we provide our Services, including when you access, download and install the App. We associate your personal data with unique identifiers. 

Sensitive Personal Data
When you consent to the collection of phenotypic data, we process your weight, height, physical activity level and other details to provide you with personalized nutrition services, including advice and tips via push notifications and/or In-App messages. Before collecting any sensitive data, we will inform you and ask your explicit consent in accordance with article 9.2.a. of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 

Other than provided above, we ask you not to send or disclose any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other beliefs, health, sex life or sexual orientation, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) to us, in or through the App, or by any other means. 

Account Data
We collect your personal data when you create an account. You may login to the App using a MyPhilips account or by using your social media profile, including your Apple account. 

 The personal data we collect may include your name, email address, country, language and password. We also process information on your App usage, including your session, login and authentication information, which we use to manage your account.

 If you log in via social media, the personal data we collect may include your basic public profile (e.g., full/short name, profile photo, identifier, gender, profile URL, birthday, homepage, and location) and your email address, which we use for authentication purposes. In this case, your social media provider may collect information on the fact that you are using the App and logging in using your social media account. Please read your social media provider’s Privacy Notice (e.g., Facebook, Google, Apple) to learn about their privacy practices, including, what type of personal data they collect, and how they use, process and protect them.

 We use your Account Data to create and manage your account and provide personalized Services. You can use your account to securely login to the App. If you create a MyPhilips account to login to the App, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password, to communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to send you strictly service-related announcements, or direct marketing communications in case you have opted-in. You may also use your MyPhilips account to order a Philips product or service, participate in a promotion or game, participate in a social media activity related to a (Philips) promotion (for example clicking \"like\" or \"share\"), and participate in product testing or surveys.

Because we use your Account Data to provide the Services, we consider this processing to be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party and lawful under Article 6.1. (b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Other Provided Data
When using the App, you can create a profile consisting of your name/nickname, a short description of yourself, your home country, your generated and favorited content and other profiles you follow. We process these details together with your private settings including your preferred cuisines, unit system, Devices you own and information we observe when you use our Services.

 We use this personal data to provide personalized Services and make you part of a community that shares cooking related content, where you can follow other community members with similar interests. We use your private settings in combination with your activity in the social community to provide you with a personalized experience of the App by presenting content that is most relevant for you, as well as sending you push notifications and/or In-App messages. These notifications or messages could contain content of third parties that we have decided to partner with in the context of the App. We do this by analyzing the data collected and using specific recommendation and filtering algorithms. 

 In some countries, the Services include the ‘Community’ feature, which allows you to see recipes from other members in your country, share your own recipes and post comments. As part of the ‘Community’ feature (i) you will easily see the foods you prefer, and your Device (s) model (e.g., Air fryer model); and (ii) other users may see your username, country, photo, your connections in the App, and the recipes you store in the App. The App will show whether the ‘Community’ feature is available in your country. 

Because we use your Other Provided Data to provide the Services, we consider this processing to be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party and lawful under Article 6.1.(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Device Data
When you choose to pair the App with your Device, we collect device-specific information whenever you access or use the Device, including the unique user device number, country of your selection, time zone and session and usage data. Depending on the Device model you use, the Device may record recipes and ingredients and send them to the App. We may use this Device data to allow you to control your Device and provide you with personalized nutrition services, including advice and tips via In-App messages and/or push notifications. We may also use this Device data to perform analytics, e.g. to learn about the use of our Devices during which times of the day.

Because your Device(s) Data are only processed when you choose to pair your Device(s) with the App for purposes of the Services, we consider this processing to be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party and lawful under Article 6.1.(b) (providing the Services) and/or based on legitimate interest under Article 6.1.(f) (performing the analytics) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

If you consent to receiving promotional communications about Philips products, services, events and promotions or the promotional communications of the partners that we have carefully selected, we may send you marketing and promotional communications via email or digital channels, such as mobile apps and social media. To be able to tailor the communications to your preferences and behavior and provide you with a more relevant and personalized experience, we may analyze your Combined Data. You may opt-out and unsubscribe from such communications at any time. 

Permissions
The App may request your permission to access your mobile device’s storage capabilities, sensors or other features (e.g. photos, agenda, contacts, camera, Wi-Fi, geo-location, or Bluetooth). We require access when strictly necessary to provide the Services as detailed below. 

 Bluetooth and WIFI. The App requires WIFI connection to connect to the internet. The App also needs Bluetooth/WIFI to connect your Device(s) to the App. You can at any time block Bluetooth/WIFI connection through the settings of the mobile device.
 Location. For some Device models, Android operating systems require coarse geo-graphic location to connect to the Device. iOS operating systems also require geo-location to recognize when the App and the Device are nearby. However, Philips will not process such data in any manner. The data will remain in your mobile device where Philips will not have access to it. You can at any time block geo-location collection through the settings of the mobile device.
 Files. The App requires access to the mobile device's files to store the language configurations and other files that the App uses to operate (e.g., manuals, recipes, graphics, media files, or other large program assets). If you delete the App, the Files will be deleted from your mobile device.
 Photos and Media. If you add a profile picture to your profile, the App requires permission to access your mobile device's camera or photo gallery. Android operating systems may request permission for Videos, however, the App will only use the permission to allow you to upload your picture. 
 Sometimes a permission is a technical precondition of the operating system of your mobile device. In such case, the App may ask your permission to access a certain sensor or data, however we will not collect such data, unless required to provide the Services. 

With whom are Personal Data shared?
Philips may disclose your personal data to third party service providers, business partners, or other third parties in accordance with this Privacy Notice and/or applicable law. 

Service Providers
We work with third-party service providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support and market our Services.

We may share your personal data with the following service providers:

 IT and Cloud Providers
These service providers deliver the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, transactional services and/or related technology required to run the App or provide the Services. 
 Analytics Service Providers
These service providers deliver the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and/or related technology that we require to perform App analytics. See also above under Cookies and Analytics. 
Philips requires its service providers to provide an adequate level of protection to your personal data similar to the level that we provide. We require our service providers to process your personal data only in accordance with our instructions and only for the specific purposes mentioned above, to have access to the minimum amount of data they need to deliver a specific service, and to protect the security of your personal data.
Other third parties
Philips may also work with third parties who process your personal data for their own purposes. If Philips shares personal data with third parties that use your personal data for their own purposes, Philips will ensure to inform you and/or obtain your consent in accordance with applicable laws before sharing your personal data. In this case, please read their privacy notices carefully as they inform about their privacy practices, including, what type of personal data they collect, how they use, process and protect them.

Please note, concerning possible third-party advertising in the App we do not share your personal data with these partners. Even if you opt in to receive marketing and if you allow all Cookies, we do not share your personal data with the advertising third party. What we do is analyze the effectiveness of such partnership campaigns and inform our partners on the effectiveness (e.g. how many App users have clicked on the ad, how many App users have invoked the offer). We are able to analyze this from reviewing the App usage and when you accept the Branch Metrics Cookie mentioned before. The external reporting of this effectiveness study is happening on an aggregated basis only, which means that our partner – the third party – will not be able to redirect this information to any individual App user. 
Philips sometimes sells a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business, to the purchasing company. All of our rights and obligations under our Privacy Notice are freely assignable by Philips to any of our affiliates, in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and we may transfer your personal data to any of our affiliates, successor entities, or new owner.

Amazon Alexa | Kitchen Plus Skill 

Depending on the Device model you use, the Kitchen Plus Skill (“Skill”) allows you to control your Device and obtain information via Amazon Alexa. 

When you enable the Skill, Philips allows you to connect your Amazon Account to the Philips account you use to login to the App. When connecting your accounts, Philips and Amazon independently adopt technical measures to validate your identity. Philips shares account identifiers but does not share your account credentials, including name or email address, with Amazon. 

When you speak to Alexa, Amazon sends a written version of your voice commands to Philips together with a unique identifier. We process this information to execute your commands and issue a response in accordance with our Privacy Notice. We share our written response with Amazon so that Amazon can inform you about the outcome of your command in accordance with Amazon’s Privacy Notice and Terms of Use. Philips and Alexa may also exchange information on the Device you decide to control through the Skill, including when you update, change or remove a Device. 

You understand that your commands and responses may amount to personal data. You also understand that Amazon provides its own services to you and by providing consent, you instruct us to share your personal data with Amazon. Amazon may process your personal data in countries outside of your country of residence, which may not provide adequate protection to personal data in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679. You can revoke your consent at any time by disabling the Skill. Please read Amazon’s Privacy Notice and Terms of Use for further information.

Cross-border transfer
Your personal data may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services you acknowledge the transfer (if any) of information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal data. 

If you are located in the EEA, your personal data may be transferred to our affiliates or service providers in non-EEA countries that are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, such as the United States, we have put in place adequate measures, such as our Binding Corporate Rules for Customer, Supplier and Business Partner Data and/or standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to protect your personal data. You may obtain a copy of these measures by following the link above or by contacting us here.

How long do we keep your data?
We will retain your personal data for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which the data is collected. The criteria we use to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time you use the App and Services; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

Your choices and rights
If you would like to submit a request to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to the processing of personal data that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to submit a request to receive an electronic copy of your personal data for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us here. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

In your request, please make clear what personal data you would like to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to its processing. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal data associated with your account, your email address or other account information, that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Where we rely on consent to collect and/or process your personal data, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before your withdrawal.

Please note that if you make use of (some of) your choices and rights, you may not be able to use, in whole or in part, our Services anymore.

When we process your personal data based on a legal obligation to which we are subject, including when you interact with us to exercise any of your rights, we consider the processing to be lawful in accordance with Article 6.1.(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Where we rely on performance of a contract to process your personal data for purposes of the Services, we may not be able to provide the Services if we do not receive your information. 

We protect your personal data
We take seriously our duty to protect the data you entrust to Philips against accidental or unauthorized alteration, loss, misuse, disclosure or access. Philips uses a variety of security technologies, technical and organizational measures to help protect your data. For this purpose we implement, among others, access controls, use firewalls and secure protocols.
Special information for parents
While the Services are not directed to children, as defined under applicable law, it is Philips’ policy to comply with the law when it requires parent or guardian permission before collecting, using or disclosing personal data of children. We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we strongly encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with his or her personal data without their consent, please contact us here. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, we will delete his/her data from our files.

Changes to this Privacy Notice
Our Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. For this reason, we reserve the right to amend or update this Privacy Notice from time to time. When we update this Privacy Notice, we will also update the date at the top of this Privacy Notice.

The new Privacy Notice will become effective immediately upon publication. If you do not agree to the revised notice, you should alter your preferences, or consider stop using our Services. By continuing to access or make use of our Services after those changes become effective, you acknowledge that you have been informed and agree to the Privacy Notice as amended.

Terms of Use – Philips NutriU App
 

Thank you for your interest in this mobile application. This mobile application (\"App\") is offered to you by Philips Domestic Appliances (China) Investment Co., Ltd. (\"Philips\"). We welcome you to use this App for your personal entertainment, there are just a few rules and restrictions we ask you to keep in mind!
 
What this App does for you:
 
1. Gives you a good on-boarding to what and how to prepare and cook food with your kitchen appliance from the start, using picture-guided recipes and tips
2. Provides continuous inspiration with suggestions and the option to search for new recipes and tips from the community, based on your personal preferences
3. The App gives you one place to easily create, customise, save, organise and share your favourite recipes and tips
4. The App may communicate over a wireless connection with Philips kitchen appliances that are capable of connecting with this App; those kitchen appliances will have \"connected\" in the model name or will otherwise indicate that they are \"connected\". The App supports establishing a nutritional health goal and, together with the information it receives from the connected kitchen appliance, helps you track and achieve it. 
5. The App also features easily searchable frequently asked questions and a link to Consumer Care for any support you might need

We encourage you to read on; by using the App, you accept the terms as mentioned below.
 
Other things that you should know about this App:
 
Licence: You may use this App in connection with the purpose as described above on a mobile device owned or controlled by you. This licence is non-transferable and is between you and Philips.
 
Third parties: It is possible that when you use this App you will (also) use a service, download a piece of software or purchase goods that are provided by a third party. Please know that those third parties may have their own applicable rules and restrictions, separate from these conditions of use. Philips is not responsible for these third parties.
 
Warranties: Our goal is to provide you with a great App and a great App user experience. Do be aware that we are only able to provide you the App \"as-is\". Although we would love to, we unfortunately cannot warrant anything about the App or its content.
 
Liability: As much faith as we have in our App, there is always the possibility that things don't work as they are supposed to. In the unfortunate event that the App does not work or any content is lost, please accept our sincerest apologies. We certainly understand that it is unfortunate and inconvenient. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty provided herein, you may notify the mobile application store where you purchased this App, and they will refund the purchase price for the App to you. Unfortunately, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we cannot accept any liability for any damages incurred as a result of your use of the App. In any event we are not liable for amounts exceeding the fees paid for purchasing the App.

Health and nutrition content: All health and nutrition content is provided for general information only. It is not a substitute for a medical advice, diagnosis or treatment from your doctor or a healthcare professional. 
A varied, balanced diet is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. A balanced diet should contain the right quantities of the right foods, including carbohydrates, dietary fibre, water, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. Each individual's dietary needs are unique.
Philips is not responsible for adverse reactions, effects, or consequences resulting from the use of any recipes or suggestions herein or hereafter.
We take great care that the nutrition information we provide is based on verified science-based sources. However, Philips is not responsible for errors or omissions in reporting or explanation. 

Special diets: Recipes can be filtered by dietary restrictions such as gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, etc. Nonetheless, industrial and regional differences are possible and we do not have control over the ingredients you use in the recipes. We recommend to always check food labels, especially if you suffer from food allergies or intolerances. 

Nutritional values calculation: The App can calculate the nutritional values of recipes. These nutritional values are based on the average values as provided by the food composition databases. Philips uses the USDA Food Composition Database for the United States and the German food composition database \"BLS - Bundes Lebensmittel Schlüssel\" for all other countries. Calculated nutritional values may deviate from actual nutritional values amongst others as a result of variations in the nutritional values of ingredients (caused by the degree of ripeness, variety etc.) 
Recommended nutrient intake (RNI): RNI represents the daily intake, which meets the nutrient requirements of almost all (97.5 percent) apparently healthy individuals in an age and sex-specific population group. The values we use for the RNI are implemented from FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the United States, from the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China for China, from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia for Indonesia, and from the European Commission for all other countries.
Nutrition and health claims: Nutrition and health claims made within the App follow from Regulation 1924/2006 of the European Commission. For the daily recommended intake, the App follows EU-REGULATION 1169/2011. 

User content: You will be able to create or upload content on the App (\"User Content\"). You can decide what you will publicly share on our App and we want you and others to enjoy our App, so please don't use our App in a way that is commonly considered inappropriate (such as obscene, violating laws and regulations, offensive, discriminatory or that infringe someone else's rights).
 
User Content is provided by users, not by Philips. We do not endorse opinions, recommendations or advice expressed therein. As this is a publically available App, sharing your content means that it becomes public. Also, when you share your content, we intend to use it for our own purposes as well, including for commercial purposes. If this is not what you would like, it is best to be cautious about what you share.
 
CONTENT REPORTING: Should you find any User Content that you consider inappropriate, offensive, misleading or with unsupported health claims, please use the Content Reporting tool/trigger to report such content, so that we can assess and if needed remove it.
 
Intellectual property: We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect users of the App to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the App in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our copyright agent with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorised to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the App; (iv) your address, telephone number and email address; (v) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorised to act on the copyright owner's behalf. Notice of claims of copyright infringement should be sent to: www.support.philips.com
 
Software Updates: We will provide the necessary updates for the period of time you may reasonably expect, and for at least two years after you purchased the Product. We may update Product Software and any Service and may do so remotely without notifying you. Where due to an action or inaction of you, updates are not installed within a reasonable time after they are made available, we shall not be liable for any impairment of the Services caused by this failure. Updates or changes are subject to these (or a newer version of the) Terms.

Jurisdiction: To the extent permitted under applicable law, these conditions of use shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the laws of the Netherlands without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
 
Your statutory rights under consumer protection laws in your country of residence remain unaffected by this choice of law. 
 
The parties hereby agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these conditions of use.
 
Sole point of contact: The mobile application store where you purchased this App is not responsible for the App nor its content. Therefore you should contact Philips via www.support.philips.com for any questions, support, product claims and third party intellectual property claims related to this App.
 
Finally: You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \"terrorist supporting\" country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. Also you irrevocably grant the mobile application store where you purchased this the right (who will be deemed to have accepted that right) to enforce these conditions against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
 
Have fun!
